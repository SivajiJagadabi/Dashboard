#A responsive dashboard with a dynamic side navigation menu, showcasing order statuses, and a detailed table presenting order-related information. It includes interactive features such as a collapsible menu, pagination, and distinct status categories for efficient order management. The dashboard also incorporates Material-UI components and icons for a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

#Navigation Bar:
The navigation bar is located at the top and includes a menu button, the title "Overview Dashboard," and a set of icons for various actions like changing themes, notifications, language, and user avatar.

#Side Drawer:
The side drawer opened and closed by the menu button, contains a list of dashboard sections such as Dashboard, Inventory, Orders, Shipping, and Channel. Each section is represented by an icon and text.

#Status Categories:
Below the side drawer, there's a list of status categories (Pending, Accepted, AWB Created, etc.) displayed horizontally. These seem to represent the different stages/orders statuses.

#Table:
A table displays order-related data with columns like Channel, Order No, Order Date, City, Customer Name, Order Value, Status, and Operation.
Each row represents an order with icons, order details, and action buttons.

#Pagination:
At the bottom of the page, there's a pagination component with buttons for navigating through different pages.

#Styling:
The styling includes specific colors for the app bar and various components, as well as a mix of Material-UI and custom styles.

#Functionality:
The component uses React state to manage the open/closed state of the side drawer and the current page in the pagination.
Icons from Material-UI and other libraries are used for visual elements.

#External Dependencies:
The code includes several imports from Material-UI and other React icon libraries.

#Responsive Design:
The dashboard layout seems to be responsive, adjusting the display based on the size of the screen
